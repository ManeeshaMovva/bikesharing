## Overview

Now that I have a good idea of how to create our story, there is still some more work to be done to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like me to do a bike trip analysis. 

For this analysis, I will use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, you’ll create a set of visualizations to show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, he number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week and the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week. Then I will create a story analysis to pitch to the investors. 

## Results:

In this visualization, I graphed the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders. Looking at the graph, we can conclude most people ride bikes for 10 minutes or less and rarely ever for 60 minutes.

In this visualization, I graphed the length of time that bikes are checked out for each gender. As you can see, most of the bike riders are male.

In this visualization, I graphed the number of bike trips by weekday for each hour of the day as a heatmap. Looking at the graph, during the weekdays, 8am and 5-6pm were the most popular times to ride bikes.

In this visualization, I graphed number of bike trips by gender for each hour for each day of the week as a heatmap. As I stated above, the popular times are 8am and 5-6pm and looking at this new graph by gender, the male gender make up most of the population that rides during those times. 

![graph 5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74915619/122999331-21b75300-d37c-11eb-8018-c86c85db0ae2.png)

In this visualization, I graphed the number of bike trips by gender for each hour for each day of the week as a heatmap. Looking at the graph, you can tell the highest number of subscribers are in the male category. 

## Summary 

The visualizations created in Tableau for the bike-sharing program make it easier for the Investors to see exactly what they would be investing and the smartest ways to go about marketing this program in Des Moines. From the visualizations, we can conclude that the weekdays in the morning at evening are popular because professionals are waking up to either exercise prior to work or after work. The male gender makes up most of the population that are subscribers which is not a surprise at all as they bike more comped to their counterparts. For a good return on investments, I would suggest marketing to fit professionals who are always on the go and if we want to focus on a gender, I’d suggest the male gender as they’re more popular with them. I believe an issue that can arise with this bike sharing app is the change in seasons. Spring and Summer will yield high profits, and I believe Winter will see a large downfall. During winter, we should consider setting up an indoor place where people could ride bikes, almost like a gym.
